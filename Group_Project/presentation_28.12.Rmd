## 2. Exploratory Data Analysis

Vehicle Operation Trend

```{r, fig.height=4}
dt_2019<- data%>%
  group_by(month=lubridate::month(beginning_date),year=lubridate::year(beginning_date)) %>%
  filter(year == 2019) %>% summarise(total_quantity = sum(quantity))
graph_2019 <- dt_2019 %>% select(month,total_quantity)
dt_2020<- data%>%
  group_by(month=lubridate::month(beginning_date),year=lubridate::year(beginning_date))%>%
  filter(year == 2020) %>% summarise(total_quantity = sum(quantity))
graph_2020 <- dt_2020 %>% select(month,total_quantity)
dt_graph = merge(graph_2019, graph_2020, by="month", )
dt_graph_2 <- reshape::melt(dt_graph, id.var='month')
p<-ggplot(dt_graph_2, aes(x=month, y=value, col=variable)) +geom_line(size=0.9) +

                                 "total_quantity.y"="#4E84C4"))
```
<font size="2"> 
- Trend charts were created by comparing process volumes in services for 2019 and 2020.<br>
- While 2019 monthly data show a similar trend, 2020 transaction volumes show highly volatility due to the pandemic effect.<br>

## 2. Exploratory Data Analysis

Proportion of Process Types

```{r, out.width="55%"}
plot_1<- data%>%
  mutate(count_total = n())%>%
  group_by(process_type)%>%
  mutate(count_vehicle_id = n())%>%
  select(process_type,count_vehicle_id, count_total)%>%
  mutate(rate_process_type = round(100*count_vehicle_id/count_total))%>%
  arrange(desc(rate_process_type))%>%
  distinct(process_type, rate_process_type)

ggplot(plot_1, aes(x="", y=rate_process_type, fill=process_type)) + geom_bar(stat="identity") + 
  coord_polar("y") + ggtitle("Proportion of Process Types") +
  theme_minimal()+ theme(axis.title.y = element_blank(), plot.title = element_text(hjust=0.5))

```
 <font size="2"> 
- The process types in the data set were shown by proportionally according to their volume.<br>
- Among the total data for two years, it was seen that the most transactions were made in fault type with 83%.<br>

## 2. Exploratory Data Analysis

Distribution in Fault Type

```{r, fig.width=9, fig.height=4}
plot_2<- data%>%
  filter(process_type == "Ariza")%>%
  group_by(Model)%>%
  summarise(count_vehicle_id = n())%>%
  arrange(desc(Model))

ggplot(plot_2, aes(x = Model, y = count_vehicle_id, fill= Model))+ ggtitle("Model Distribution in Fault Type") +
  geom_bar(stat="identity") +theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=90, size=9, vjust=0.5,hjust=1))
```
 <font size="2"> 
- The most processed fault type was filtered and the model distribution was created.<br>
- The most processed model type with fault type is seen as model 23 from the graphic.<br>

## 2. Exploratory Data Analysis

Analyzing Min, Max and Mean of The Vehicle Kms

.pull-left[

```{r, fig.height=8}
plot_3<- data %>%
  group_by(Model)%>%
  summarise(min_km=min(vehicle_km), max_km = max(vehicle_km), mean_km = mean(vehicle_km))%>%

<font size="2">
- The distribution of the vehicle kms was plotted according to the models.

## 2. Exploratory Data Analysis

The Usage Amount of The Material Types

```{r, fig.width=9, fig.height=4}
plot_5<- data %>%
  group_by(process_type, material_type)%>%
  summarise(count = sum(quantity))%>%
  arrange(desc(count))

  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = function(x) format(x, scientific = FALSE)) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90), legend.position = "none")+
  labs(title = "Total Quantity According to Material Type ",
       x = "Process Type",
       y = "Quantity")
```
<font size="2"> 
- It was seen that the "diğer", "parça" and "oil" materials were ranked in order of high to low, respectively, according to their usage amounts.<br>

## 2. Exploratory Data Analysis

The Most Popular Dealers

```{r, fig.width=9, fig.height=5}
plot_6 <- data %>%
  count(dealer_city)%>%
  mutate(percentage = 100*round(n/sum(n),3))%>%
  arrange(desc(percentage))

plot_6%>%
  filter(percentage >= 1.0)%>%

ggplot(aes(x=percentage, y=reorder(dealer_city, percentage), fill=percentage)) +
  geom_col() +
  scale_fill_gradient("percentage", low="thistle1", high="thistle4") +
  geom_text(aes(label = paste(format(percentage,digits=1), "%")), size=4, position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5)) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "none", plot.title = element_text(vjust = 0.5)) +
  labs(x = "Percentages",
       y = "Dealers",
       title = "The Most Popular Dealers")
```
<font size="2"> 
- The calculated rates was observed that the transactions were concentrated in the Marmara Region, where industry and transportation are intense, and in the **Akdeniz** and **Ege** regions, where tourism activities are intense.

## 2. Exploratory Data Analysis

The Total Price According to Types of Model

```{r, fig.width=9, fig.height=5}
plot_7 <- data %>%
  group_by(Model, production_date) %>%
  summarise(total_price = sum(price)) %>%
  mutate(age_of_car = as.numeric(format(Sys.Date(), "%Y"))-production_date)%>%
  arrange(desc(total_price))

ggplot(plot_7, aes(x = Model, y = total_price, fill= Model))+
  geom_point(stat="identity", position = "stack") +theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=90, size=9, vjust=0.5,hjust=1))+
  labs(x="Model", y="Total Price (TL)", fill ="Types of Model", title = "The Total Price According to Types of Model")

```
<font size="2"> 
- The dataset is grouped according to the model production date variables, and it is aimed to find the model with the highest service expenditure.<br>
- **Model 23** was seen to be the most costly model.

## 3. Shiny App

## 4. Conclusion

1. The operation trend was changed in 2020 due to the pandemic issue.It should not be overlooked that this situation may change the demands in the next few years.
2. Almost 83% of the transactions made in the services consist of “Ariza”.
3. Model 23 is the most expensive vehicle model, as it is the most frequently visited to the dealers.
4. It was seen that the “diğer”, “parça” and “yag” materials were ranked in order of high to low, respectively, according to their usage amounts in whole process types.
5. It was observed that the transactions were concentrated in the Marmara Region(Istanbul), where industry and transportation are intense, and in the Akdeniz and Ege regions(Antalya, İzmir), where tourism activities are intense.
